## Painful Prologue
- Painful Prologue
-  Who do I want to be? And: What
path will I take?
-  “THE OBSTACLE IS THE WAY
-  “EGO IS THE
ENEMY”
- I wrote this book not because I have attained some wisdom I feel qualified to
preach, but because it’s the book I wish existed at critical turning points in my
own life. 

While the author became successful at a very early stage in life, he learnt that no success story is truly complete. *Leaving out the ugly side of things most a times.* He started well but over time he began facing tough challenges which costed him alot of his fourtunes and good name and most of these was as a result of **Ego**, which is often associated with success, ambitions and accomplishments.  


Like my other books, this one is deeply influenced by Stoic philosophy and
indeed all the great classical thinkers. I borrow heavily from them all in my
writing just as I have leaned on them my entire life. If there is anything that
helps you in this book, it will be because of them and not me.

*The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.
—RICHARD FEYNMAN*

## Introduction
- Wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, your worst enemy already lives inside you: your ego.

## ASPIRE

### Talk, Talk, Talk
### To Be or To Do
### Become a student
### Don't be Passionate
### Follow the canvas strategy
### Restrain Yourself
### Get out of your own head
*A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch
with reality and lives in a world of illusions.*
— **ALAN WATTS**
### The Danger of Early Pride
*A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are
looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.*
**—C. S. LEWIS**
