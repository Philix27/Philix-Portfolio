## Painful Prologue
I wrote this book not because I have attained some wisdom I feel qualified to
preach, but because it’s the book I wish existed at critical turning points in my
own life. 

While the author became successful at a very early 
stage in life, he learnt that no success story is truly complete. 
*Leaving out the ugly side of things most a times.* 
He started well but over time he began facing tough 
challenges which costed him alot of his fourtunes and 
good name and most of these was as a result of **Ego**, 
which is often associated with success, ambitions and accomplishments.  


- *The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. —RICHARD FEYNMAN*

## Introduction
Wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, your worst enemy already lives inside you: your ego.

# Part I - ASPIRE

We are setting out to do something new, something innovative
after coming up with a great idea, many a times we tend not to 
reach our final destination due to our ego  and lack of humility.

Facts are better than dreams: While we may have great visions and dreams 
we should also learn to detach ourselves from thatese 
aspirations and see tings for what they truly are - self awareness.
  
## Talk, Talk, Talk
- *Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know. - Lao Tzu*
  
We have to be concious about the things we say for there will always 
be temptation to talk and hype instead of taking action and doing the work.

Talking is highly encourage in our modern day society especially via social media 
platforms were we are 
always being promted to say what's 
on our mind or make a tweet, which futher leads us to talking.

Sometimes silence isn't a sign or thesame as weaknss. 
Silence could mean strength especially in the early stages of our journey towards our goals.

To express what is still in thought could weaken actions.

The more difficult the task, the more uncertain the outcome, 
the more costly talk will be and futher we run from actual accountability. 

The relationship between work and chatter is that on kills the other.

## To Be or To Do
Colonel John Boyd usually adviced young soldiers -  
One day you would have to make this decision: To Be or To Do.

**To Be:** Make compromises, turn your back on friends 
especially for politics, recognition, incentives, commitments e.t.c.

**To Do:** Be yourself, Set principles, Doing what you love most for genuine reasons. 

Apperance can be deceiving, network, size of paychecks, job titles, number of fans or followers e.t.c.
Choices you make on a daily basis defines who you become (especially what you give your time and resources to).

## Become a student
By being a student you place your ego in another person's hand. 
You have to be humble to learn because education cannot be hacked, neither can you fool your teacher.

A student constly strive to learn more and improve. Always seek for feedback especially 
from genuine people (such as your superiors) who aren't scared to tell you the truth.
Family and friends will always try to please you.

Ego would make one see only the positive feedback, and 
rationalize every other opposing opinions to suit his feeling.

## Don't be Passionate
## Follow the canvas strategy
## Restrain Yourself

## Get out of your own head
*A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch
with reality and lives in a world of illusions.*  **ALAN WATTS**

## The Danger of Early Pride
*A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are
looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.*
**—C. S. LEWIS**

This section focuses on how pride can lead to ones downfall. Especially pride that comes after temporary success. Pride can lead to a myopic view of a situation.

## Work, Work Work
- *The best plan is only good intentions unless it degenerates into work. —PETER DRUCKER*
- *You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do -Henry Ford*

It is not enough to have big dreams and aspirations but rather 
put in the hardwork to make that awesome idea a reality.
