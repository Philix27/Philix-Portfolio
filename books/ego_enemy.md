## Painful Prologue
I wrote this book not because I have attained some wisdom I feel qualified to
preach, but because it’s the book I wish existed at critical turning points in my
own life. 

While the author became successful at a very early 
stage in life, he learnt that no success story is truly complete. 
*Leaving out the ugly side of things most a times.* 
He started well but over time he began facing tough 
challenges which costed him alot of his fourtunes and 
good name and most of these was as a result of **Ego**, 
which is often associated with success, ambitions and accomplishments.  


- *The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. —RICHARD FEYNMAN*

## Introduction
Wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, your worst enemy already lives inside you: your ego.

# Part I - ASPIRE

We are setting out to do something new, something innovative
after coming up with a great idea, many a times we tend not to 
reach our final destination due to our ego  and lack of humility.

Facts are better than dreams: While we may have great visions and dreams 
we should also learn to detach ourselves from thatese 
aspirations and see tings for what they truly are - self awareness.
  
## Talk, Talk, Talk
- *Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know. - Lao Tzu*
  
We have to be concious about the things we say for there will always 
be temptation to talk and hype instead of taking action and doing the work.

Talking is highly encourage in our modern day society especially via social media 
platforms were we are 
always being promted to say what's 
on our mind or make a tweet, which futher leads us to talking.

Sometimes silence isn't a sign or thesame as weaknss. 
Silence could mean strength especially in the early stages of our journey towards our goals.

To express what is still in thought could weaken actions.

The more difficult the task, the more uncertain the outcome, 
the more costly talk will be and futher we run from actual accountability. 

The relationship between work and chatter is that on kills the other.

## To Be or To Do
Colonel John Boyd usually adviced young soldiers -  
One day you would have to make this decision: To Be or To Do.

**To Be:** Make compromises, turn your back on friends 
especially for politics, recognition, incentives, commitments e.t.c.

**To Do:** Be yourself, Set principles, Doing what you love most for genuine reasons. 

Apperance can be deceiving, network, size of paychecks, job titles, number of fans or followers e.t.c.
Choices you make on a daily basis defines who you become (especially what you give your time and resources to).

## Become a student
By being a student you place your ego in another person's hand. 
You have to be humble to learn because education cannot be hacked, neither can you fool your teacher.

A student constly strive to learn more and improve. Always seek for feedback especially 
from genuine people (such as your superiors) who aren't scared to tell you the truth.
Family and friends will always try to please you.

Ego would make one see only the positive feedback, and 
rationalize every other opposing opinions to suit his feeling.

## Don't be Passionate
## Follow the canvas strategy
## Restrain Yourself

## Get out of your own head
*A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch
with reality and lives in a world of illusions.*  **ALAN WATTS**

## The Danger of Early Pride
*A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are
looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.*
**—C. S. LEWIS**

This section focuses on how pride can lead to ones downfall. Especially pride that comes after temporary success. Pride can lead to a myopic view of a situation.

## Work, Work Work
- *The best plan is only good intentions unless it degenerates into work. —PETER DRUCKER*
- *You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do -Henry Ford*

It is not enough to have big dreams and aspirations but rather 
put in the hardwork to make that awesome idea a reality.

## For everything that comes next, ego is the enemy

# Part II - SUCCCESS

## Always Stay a Student

- *Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him. —RALPH WALDO EMERSON*

## Don't Tell Yourself a Story

- *Myth becomes myth not in the living but in the retelling. —DAVID MARANISS*

## What is important to you?
- *To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age. —ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON*
  
## Entitlement, Control, and Paranoia
- *One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly important. —BERTRAND RUSSELL*
  
## Managing Yourself
- *It is not enough to have great qualities; we should also have the management of them. —LA ROCHEFOUCAULD*

## Beware the disease of me
- *If I am not for myself who will be for me? If I am only for myself, who am I? —HILLEL*


## Meditate on the Immensity
- *A monk is a man who is separated from all and who is in harmony with all. —EVAGRIUS PONTICUS*
 
## Maintain your sobriety

## For what often comes next, ego is the enemy...
We must try to avoid the undeiscplined pursuit for more. Once we are successful the need for
publicity, attention, celerity lifestyle usually arises, and it is at this stage Ego is capable 
of destroying a man.We become delusional and assume the world revovles around us. A brief reminder
is that just because you did something once, doesn’t mean you’ll
be able to do it successfully forever. 

# Part II - FAILURE

As we work towards our aspirations we should bear it in mind that
no one is permanently successful and not everyone finds success on
first attempt.

At any point in our journey life can take a twist, fate could happen, what 
you least expect can happen to you, even your greatest fears do come into reality.
Sabotage, Unfairness, Adversity, Trials, Tragedy, all these should be seen as a trial
which are meant to build you else one might get sunk by it.

Sometimes failure has it advantages because it helps refine us, build and prepare us for 
the future and futher unforseen circumstances. So the way we react towards failure matters 
a lot.

In times of failure we need to be strong and posses the confidence and willingness to endure and
also a sense of purpose else our ego betray us.

## Alive or Dead Time

- *Live without wasted time - PARISIAN POLITICAL SLOGAN*
  
## The Effort is Enough
- *What matters to an active man is to do the right thing; whether the right thing comes to pass should not bother him. —GOETHE*
  
In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even
perfectly. Yet the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, jealousy,
or even a resounding yawn from the world.
Depending on what motivates us, this response can be crushing. If ego holds
sway, we’ll accept nothing less than full appreciati 

Sometimes doing just the work is enugh. 
Though there may be times when the result we anticipate is not what we get i return, 
but we just have to be contented 
with the work we have done.

## The Effort is Enough 

If you shut up truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow, and gather to itself such
explosive power that the day it bursts through it will blow up everything in its way.
—EMILE ZOLA

## The Fight Club
Sometimes we may experience illful things, bad experiences which may lower our spirit. 
This sad times might have even been a product of our ego but one needs to settle down and 
make a reassessment on previous actions and in the past. Figure out where you went wrong 
so that you can learn from it and avoid making same mistake in future. Be humble.
## Draw The Line It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character.
—MARCUS AURELIUS The only real failure is abandoning your principles. Killing what you love
because you can’t bear to part from it is selfish and stupid. If your reputation
can’t absorb a few blows, it wasn’t worth anything in the first place. Learn to draw the line, know when enough damage has been donwe a. Then stop and have a rethink on how to resolve the problem on ground rather than seeking for more dubvious means oas a solution. ## MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SCORECARD For us, the scoreboard can’t be the only scoreboard. Warren Buffett has said
the same thing, making a distinction between the inner scorecard and the
external one. Your potential, the absolute best you’re capable of—that’s the
metric to measure yourself against. Your standards are. Winning is not enough.
People can get lucky and win. People can be assholes and win. Anyone can win.
But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves. 
- I don’t like work—no man does—but I like what is in the work—the chance to 
find yourself. —JOSEPH CONRAD 
- Learn not to take anything too personal. Whether someone offends uyou, 
or steals your idea or tries to disgrace you,seize to retaliate or become 
aggressive because this may lead to your downfall. Always show love and hate will
never catvh up with you.

It makes all the steps hard, but failure is the one it will make permanent. Unless
we learn, right here and right now, from our mistakes. Unless we use this
moment as an opportunity to understand ourselves and our own mind better, ego
will seek out failure like true north.
